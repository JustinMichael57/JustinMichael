    <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
    <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
    <p>Over the last 100 years no one exemplifies these values for me more than Michael Jackson. He broke racial barriers, redefined pop culture, and used his platform to promote humanitarian causes. Through his music and philanthropy, he touched the hearts of millions and left an indelible mark on the world.</p>
